# Design paradigm:
# 2 inputs, one for pitch, one for volume
# 1 output, sound
# if there's time, add knob or other input to be able to control another parameter such as modulating something such as a reverb effect
# show the math for how the electric fields work and where they go
# use libraries whree necessary
